Setting the server address

In order to specify the good Rest API server, you need to edit the Constantes.java file located in app/src/main/java/com/example/dorian/sopraandroid/

And change the following line:

    public static final String SERVER = "[ADDRESS:PORT]";

By replacing **[ADDRESS:PORT]** with the value you need.
